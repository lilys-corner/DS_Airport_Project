/*
1:
    Create weighted directed graph G from the provided .csv file
        Can turn this into .txt if it won't accept .csv
        Two weights for each length, Distance and Cost
2:
    Find shortest path between origin airport and destination airport
        Provide message if no path
3:
    Find all shortest paths between origin airports and all airports in the destination state
        Provide message if no path
4:
    Find shortest path between origin airport and destination with stops
        Provide message if no path
        3 stops = Source -> stop 1 -> stop 2 -> stop 3 -> Destination
5:
    Direct flight connections
        Total = inbound + outbound
6:
    Create undirected graph G_u from G
        Only one directed edge (between u and v) case:
            Ignore Distance, Cost is an undirected weight edge
        Two directed edges (between u and v) case:
            Keep edge with minimum Cost value
            Ignore distance, Cost is an undirected weight edge
7:
    Create a Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) w/ Prim's algorithm on G_u
        Output content of MST and total cost (see sample output)
8:
    Create a Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) w/ Kruskal's algorithm on G_u
        Output content of MST and total cost (see sample output)
